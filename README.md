This module is useful to create s3 bucket with server access logging enabled. 

It's always recommend to create one S3 bucket for logs delivery to capture from different source S3 buckets. Do not use self s3 buckets for logs delivery which increases the unnecessary storage and cost. 

Once you create this log bucket, please refer "jayaworld-s3-bucket" for creating general S3 buckets.
